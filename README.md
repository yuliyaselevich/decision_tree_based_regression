# Joint AMSR-E/CloudSat analysis and extrapolation of curtain-like swath of the CloudSat radar (~ 1.3 km wide)
AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System) was an instrument onboard the Aqua satellite operated by NASA. It was designed to observe various microwave frequencies to gather information about different Earth parameters. 
I correlated AMSR-E 36-GHz and 89-GHz brightness temperatures (which is sensitive to ice particles lofted by convection) with CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) echo characteristics.
